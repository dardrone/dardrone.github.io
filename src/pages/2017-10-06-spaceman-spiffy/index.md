> **tl;dr** Check out <a href="https://darrenjennings.github.io/spaceman-spiffy" target="_blank">this cool app I built!</a>


I recently visited my hometown of Louisville, KY, where the coffee flows like wild horses. I had some down time and thought it would be cool to dive deep into [React][reactjs.org]. I heard the React core team built their cool new [docs](https://reactjs.org/) page using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) so I forked Gatsby's [blogging template](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and set to work. 

While in Louisville I used my [Frontend Master](https://www.frontendmasters.com) subscription to listen to [Brian Holt's](https://twitter.com/holtbt) introduction course on Reactjs. I had previously built a react app at [zTailors][https://www.generationtux.com] and had learned a lot, but was glad to learn some tips and also to catch up on what's current in the react toolkit. Brian does a great job and I used the opportunity to build a Calvin and Hobbes Search.

Some of the technologies I used:
 
* [React](reactjs.org)
* [airbnb react dates](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates) - for slick date picking.
* [Flow](https://flow.org/) - a static type checker for javascript.
* [Semantic UI](semantic-ui.com) - a UI library for quick bootstrapping.
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) Javascript linter, specifically Airbnb's config.
* [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) - Python scraper for populating the massive json config from [Go Comies](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes) so that the images can be cross domain hosted.

I named the app after the esteemable Spaceman Spiff.

> Spaceman Spiff is the most prominent of Calvin's many alter egos. He is a space explorer who often does battle with aliens, either on foot or in space.
