I had some down time and thought it would be cool to learn <a href="">React</a>. I heard they built their cool new <a href="">docs</a> page using <a href="">Gatsby</a> so I copied Gatsby’s <a href="">blogging template</a>. While in Louisville I used my <a href="">Frontend Master</a> subscription to listen to <a href="">Brian Holt’s</a> introduction course on Reactjs. I had previously built a react app at a previous <a href="">company</a> and had learned a lot, but was glad to learn some tips and also to catch up on what’s current in javascript. Brian does a great job and I used the opportunity to build a Calvin and Hobbes Search.</p>\n<h3>Spaceman-spiffy</h3>',frontmatter:{title:"spaceman-spiffy",date:"October 06, 2017"}}},pathContext:{path:"/spaceman-spiffy/"}}}});
